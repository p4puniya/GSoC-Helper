## Selecting an Organisation
Frankly, there's nothing like a good or bad organization. Though the number of applicants selected for open-source programs differs based on the organization's size, this doesn't necessarily mean that selecting a big organization to contribute to will increase your chances. Instead, you should be more focused on selecting a project that goes in hand with your technical skills. A resource I used was [GSoC Organisations](https://www.gsocorganizations.dev/) to filter the organizations based on my skillset.

## Selecting a Project
In most cases, you won't know about all the complete tech stack that's being used in the project. So, if you know about 40% of the tech stack and can make sense of the code published on github, select that project and start contributing to it.

## Creating a GSoC Proposal
Creating a good GSoC proposal is essential for your GSoC Application. A general checklist while creating yours would be:
1. Include your project summary.(A paragraph that gives the reader a general idea about what your project.)
2. Mention why and how your project will benifit the Org.
3. Include a detailed summary for the delieverables.(Basically, how your plan-of-action to bring the project to completion.)
4. Include the weekly time-line for your delieverables that will act like a roadmap for you during your GSoC period.
5. Make sure to include a summary about yourself and your past contributions.( You can also mention contributions to other organisations, to help the people get an idea about your expertise.)
Refer [this repo](https://github.com/Google-Summer-of-Code-Archive/gsoc-proposals-archive) for previous GSoC proposals.

Tips:
- Some orgs have a set format for their org, make sure to connect with a mentor before you prepare your own proposal.
- Get your proposal crosschecked by an org mentor before you do a final submission.
