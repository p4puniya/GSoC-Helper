## Selecting an Organisation
Frankly, there's nothing like a good or bad organization. Though the number of applicants selected for open-source programs differs based on the organization's size, this doesn't necessarily mean that selecting a big organization to contribute to will increase your chances. Instead, you should be more focused on selecting a project that goes in hand with your technical skills. A resource I used was [GSoC Organisations](https://www.gsocorganizations.dev/) to filter the organizations based on my skillset.
